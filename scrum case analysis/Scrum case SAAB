# Scrum in Military Aviation

## a case analysis about scrum in hardware

Is building a Jet Fighter Faster, Cheaper, Better with Scrum?
The answer may surprise you, yes! it is possible to bring the scrum framework to the military area for example. usually this area brings more traditional models such as waterfall, but scrum can bring a better level of understanding, bring prioritization and stress reduction. the case that I am analyzing, for example, Saab Aeronautics is a great example, when we talk about more traditional models of projects they can become not only expensive, but can bring a huge workload and stress to the workplace, using the ceremonies scrum and its pillars in the right way makes it possible (in a macro way) to create a project and deliver it with value without having to wait years for a delivery as scrum makes it possible to deliver value with the minimum of time.
Saab introduced Agile practices approximately ten years ago during updates of the previous Gripen versions. First, small independent teams of software developers adopted Scrum, serving as incubators for
Agile. 
Rigorous Scrum was the initial backbone of the Saab Agile framework, and as it spread,
it evolved through continuous improvement. The cornerstones of Scrum are still present,
but other aspects have evolved to allow teams to interpret and tailor the framework to their
particular process.
In the new Gripen fighter program, the Gripen E, Agile practices are implemented at every
level and in every discipline: software, hardware and fuselage design. The Saab Agile
framework contains practices from Lean, Scrum, Kanban, XP and others. Practices are
not prescriptive. Individual teams and groups have the autonomy to develop the best
implementation for their particular local context. Different teams have varied levels of
Agile maturity. For that reason autonomy at the team level is critical, giving teams the
freedom to incrementally improve their practice constantly.
Scrum creates a good framework to organize teams, and provide transparency in order to
improve and enhance communication. Saab adds constraints such as common pulse in
order to scale and enable multiple teams to play in tune. At the same time Saab provide
degrees of freedom for individual progress, enhancing autonomy.
The Agile practice at Saab focuses on enabling teams to continuously improve their perform-
ance. The goal is for every engineer, every day, to carry out the highest priority task with a
minimum of obstacles. This creates an environment of clarity for the teams,
maximizing their sense of commitment. Through Agile practices Saab can manage
variability and drive performance with clarity and commitment.
Was the result groundbreaking? why?
Absolutely! The result is an aircraft delivered for lower cost, with higher speed, and greater quality.
Which is usually not the case for the industry that not only takes years to develop products that deliver value but also chooses a more traditional model for its projects.
